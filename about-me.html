           <p>I have a background in production, went to school for cinematography, but it soon became a hobby instead of a career path. I have since decided that I would like to pursue a career in programming.</p>
           <p><em>Most</em> of my family works in the tech industry, and they are all programmers except for one.</p>
           <p>I was motivated to start Epicodus because of this, I think that the logic behind programming appeals to me much more than other careers do.</p>

          <p>I studied motion graphics and animation for some time.</p>
          <p>I soon after switched my studies to cinematography when I realized I liked to be the one in control of the camera. I then started a small buisness with a buisness partner and we began video production locally in Portland.</p>
          <p>I am skilled in multiple programs involved with production, including the Adobe Suite.</p>
